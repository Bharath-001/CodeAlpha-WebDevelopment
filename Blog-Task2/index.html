                    The Mackay City Auto Group North Queensland Games is definitely something worth visiting
                    Queensland for during the autumn months. Majority of the tourists are going to visit
                    Queensland for just the sightseeing spots around and while that’s okay, if you are visiting
                    around in Autumn, it would be an absolute shame if you miss out on some of the 
                    most popular events around.
